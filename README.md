# modified_lenet
A simple deep learning model I built on Python as part of an Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning coursework assignment, based off the popular LeNet model. The accompanying report carries a description of the model and comparisons to the LeNet model. 

Note: This model was trained on a provided Image dataset that I cannot share (the file is too big!), but you can add in your own dataset to train this model.
